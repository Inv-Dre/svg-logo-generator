# svg-logo-generator

## Description
I created the svg logo generator so people trying to launch a start up or brand could make simple logos. The user is prompted to answer questions about the appearance of their logo and the user receives the logo they envisioned in seconds. While making this, I became more comfortable with classes and methods.

## Installation

1. git clone this in your terminal
